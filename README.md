# mygrails
This is a demo project for grails begginer. If you are a junior or a mid level programmer,
you can get some concept or syntactically idea about:
 
->How to work with grails configuration?
->How to work with grails end point to service with view rendering?	
->How to work with grails orm on hibernate?
->How to work with grails exception handling and hibernate ehcache?
->How to work with grails logger and logback custom configuration?
->How to work with spring aop in grails?

Most probably you can gather knowledge over all groovy and grails with spring boot and hibernate.
Thank you very much, enjoy!!
